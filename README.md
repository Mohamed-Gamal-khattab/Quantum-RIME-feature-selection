# Quantum-RIME-feature-selection
This repository contains the feature selection code for diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from MRI scans. Using Quantum RIME (QRIME), which integrates Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization with the RIME: A physics-based optimization algorithm, this algorithm enables efficient dimensionality reduction to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
